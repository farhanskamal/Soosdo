**Key Features**:
- `validateNode()` - Validates and sanitizes node objects
- `validateConnection()` - Validates and sanitizes connection objects  
- `validateBoard()` - Validates and sanitizes board objects
- Safe property access utilities with fallbacks
- Error handling wrappers for operations
- Data repair functions for corrupted state

**Lines**: 215

### 2. `/src/utils/connectors.ts` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Advanced connector system for node-to-node connections
**Key Features**:
- `getConnectionPorts()` - Calculate connection port positions
- `calculateConnectorPath()` - Generate smooth Bezier curve paths
- `canCreateConnection()` - Validate if connections can be created
- `createConnection()` - Create new connections with validation
- `getConnectionPoint()` - Handle drag operations and snapping
- Connection validation and rendering utilities

**Lines**: 326

### 3. `/CRITICAL_BUGS_FIXED.md` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of all bug fixes
**Content**: Detailed explanation of fixes, implementation details, and testing status

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/utils/historyManager.ts`
**Changes**: Enhanced with validation and error handling
**Modifications**:
- Added validation imports
- Enhanced undo/redo operations with try-catch blocks
- Added sanitization of action data
- Improved node and connection validation in all operations
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Enhanced all record methods with validation

**Impact**: Eliminates "color" property errors in undo/redo operations

### 2. `/src/components/FlowchartCanvas.tsx`
**Changes**: Major improvements to connector system and error handling
**Modifications**:
- Added imports for validation and connector utilities
- Enhanced `renderConnection()` with validation and improved path calculation
- Updated `handleNodeConnection()` and related functions with proper port handling
- Improved connection preview with curved paths
- Added conditional rendering of input ports (not shown for start nodes)
- Enhanced error handling throughout component

**Impact**: Fixes connector arrows and enables proper node-to-node connections

### 3. `/src/components/AIAssistant.tsx`
**Changes**: Enhanced chat functionality and AI responses
**Modifications**:
- Added `generateAIResponse()` function with contextual understanding
- Enhanced welcome message with board-specific information
- Improved error messages for code generation
- Added better feedback during processing
- Enhanced troubleshooting guidance
- Improved user experience with richer AI interactions

**Impact**: Provides more intelligent and helpful AI assistant functionality

### 4. `/src/utils/connectors.ts` - Referenced in canvas
**Usage**: Utilized throughout FlowchartCanvas for all connector operations

### 5. `/src/utils/validation.ts` - Referenced in multiple files
**Usage**: Used in HistoryManager and FlowchartCanvas for data validation

#### Undo/Redo System
- [ ] Add nodes and test undo (Ctrl+Z)
- [ ] Test redo (Ctrl+Y) operations
- [ ] Verify no "color" property errors in console
- [ ] Test multiple sequential operations

#### Connector System  
- [ ] Create connections between nodes
- [ ] Verify smooth curved connector paths
- [ ] Test connection deletion
- [ ] Validate port positioning and interaction

#### AI Chat Interface
- [ ] Open AI Assistant panel
- [ ] Send test messages to chat
- [ ] Verify contextual AI responses
- [ ] Test "Generate Code" functionality
